Foos React
==========

# Installation
### Prerequisites
- NodeJS and npm
- MongoDB (create a db named `foos`, and collections named `players`, `teams`, and `matches`)
- Bower `npm install -g bower`
- Gulp `npm install -g gulp`

### Steps
- `git clone https://github.com/epzilla/foos-react.git`
- `cd` into the repo
- `npm install`
- `bower install`
- `gulp` to start server

## TODOs
- Make MongoDB seeding better.
- Add ability to load profile pics
- Add some more in-depth stats (head-to-head between players/teams in particular, and maybe some simple algorithms to try and predict outcomes)
